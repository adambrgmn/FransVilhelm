# useLifecycle

`useLifecycle` is not one hook but three â€“ `useMount`, `useUpdate` and
`useUnmount`. They are hooks that can be used as replacements for lifecycle
hooks found on class components.

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useMount, useUpdate, useUnmount } from '@fransvilhelm/hooks';

const Lifecycles = () => {
  useMount(() => console.log('Mounted'));
  useUpdate(() => console.log('Updated'));
  useUnmount(() => console.log('Unmounted'));

  return <p />;
};
```

## Example

<Playground>
  <UseLifecycleExample />
</Playground>

## Parameters

### `useMount`

`useMount` accepts a callback function that will be called once directly after
initial render of the component.

### `useUpdate`

`useUpdate` accepts a callback function that will be called on every update
happening on the component (state or props updated). It's practically
`useEffect` but without the initial call on first render.

### `useUnmount`

`useUnmount` accepts a callback function that will be called once in connection
to the component being unmounted.
